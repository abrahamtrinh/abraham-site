# This is my custom portfolio website.

This project was created with React and TailwindCSS.\
The purpose of this project was to recreate my old portfolio website using more modern technologies.\
The old site used pure HTML and CSS and was rather simple and boring. \
I followed a few tutorials to understand the React and just jumped right into using TailwindCSS. \
Over the course of a few days I was able to produce this website! \
